**Lisp Compiler / Interpreter**

This project is a compiler and interpreter for a Lisp based on MIT Scheme. 
It is a self-study project born out of an interest in programming languages and a desire to practice using the C++ STL.
The currently implemented language subset is Turing-complete, and features include:

- Tail-call optimization
- Lambdas
- Closures
- Garbage collection

The compiler is under construction - watch this space for new features!
